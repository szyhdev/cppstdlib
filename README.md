The C++ Standard Library, 2nd Edition

The Best-Selling C++ Resource. Now Updated for C++11.

The C++ standard library provides a set of common classes and interfaces that greatly extend the core C++ language. The library, however, is not self-explanatory. To make full use of its components–and to benefit from their power–you need a resource that does far more than list the classes and their functions.

The C++ Standard Library: A Tutorial and Reference, Second Edition, describes this library as now incorporated into the new ANSI/ISO C++ language standard (C++11). The book provides comprehensive documentation of each library component, including an introduction to its purpose and design; clearly written explanations of complex concepts; the practical programming details needed for effective use; traps and pitfalls; the exact signature and definition of the most important classes and functions; and numerous examples of working code. The book focuses in particular on the Standard Template Library (STL), examining containers, iterators, function objects, and STL algorithms.

The book covers all the new C++11 library components, including
- Concurrency
- Fractional arithmetic
- Clocks and timers
- Tuples
- New STL containers
- New STL algorithms
- New smart pointers
- New locale facets
- Random numbers and distributions
- Type traits and utilities
- Regular expressions

The book also examines the new C++ programming style and its effect on the standard library, including lambdas, range-based for  loops, move semantics, and variadic templates.
